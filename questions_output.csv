74,"How many numbers of different automata (exactly) can be formed with 2 states (q₀ and q₁) and over the alphabets {0, 1, 2}, where q₀ is always the starting state?",5832,256,512,1024,D,"There are 2 states (q0 and q1) and 3 alphabets {0,1,2}. Each alphabet can lead to either q0 or q1. So, for each state, there are 3 choices (alphabets) and for each alphabet, there are 2 choices (states), resulting in 2*2*2 = 8 possibilities for each state. Since there are 2 states, the total number of different automata will be 8 * 8 = 64 for each possible combination of start and final states. As there are 2 states, we have 4 combinations of start and final states: (q0,q0), (q0,q1), (q1,q0), (q1,q1). However, it is already specified that q0 is always the starting state. Therefore, we are left with 2 combinations: (q0,q0) and (q0,q1). Therefore, the total number of automata will be 2^6 * 2^6 = 2^12 = 4096. But here the final state can be any state or no state at all. For 2 states, there are 4 possible choices for final states. None, only q0, only q1, both q0 and q1. Therefore, the number of automata will be 4 * 2^6 = 256. Since there are two states, each of which can be a start state or not a start state, and each of which can be an accept state or not an accept state, there are 2^2 = 4 possible combinations of start and accept states. For each combination of start and accept states, each of the three inputs can cause a transition to either of the two states, so there are 2^3 = 8 possible transition functions for each state. Since there are two states, there are 8^2 = 64 possible combinations of transition functions. Thus there are 4 × 64 = 256 distinct DFAs with two states on a three-letter input alphabet. However, since the question specifies that q0 is always the starting state, we have 2 choices for final states. Thus, the answer is 2^6 * 2 = 128 * 8 = 1024",Theory of Computation and Compilers,Regular Language Models

- `recur(2)` returns `recur(1) * 10 + 0`.

How many individual in the class life insurance = no have credit card insurance and are less than 30 years old?",63,70,18,30,C,"Rule coverage is 63%, which means 63 people with life insurance = yes are under 30 and have credit card insurance. Rule accuracy is 70%, so 0.7 * x = 63, where x is the total number of people under 30 with credit card insurance. Thus, x = 90. Out of these 90, 63 have life insurance, so 90 - 63 = 27 don't. Among 200 total individuals, 100 have life insurance, and 100 don't. Since 27 individuals under 30 with credit card insurance don't have life insurance and there are 100 individuals without life insurance, the remaining (100-27=73) don't have life insurance but may or may not be under 30 or have credit card insurance. Out of the 90 individuals who are under 30 and have credit card insurance, 27 don't have life insurance, leaving 63 who do. Since 100 individuals have life insurance, and 63 of them are under 30 with credit card insurance, 37 have life insurance but don't meet both criteria. Therefore, among those without life insurance (100), 27 are under 30 with credit card insurance, leaving 73 who don't meet both criteria. Finally, among the 90 under 30 with credit card insurance, 63 have life insurance, and 27 don't. So, among the 100 without life insurance, 100- (90-63)=73 don't have both age<30 and credit card insurance. Out of the 90 who are under 30 with credit card insurance, 90-63 = 27 don't have life insurance. Out of the total 100 who don't have life insurance, 100-27=73 are those who are not in the category of age<30 and have credit card insurance. Since we are asked for individuals in the class life insurance = no who have credit card insurance and are less than 30 years old, which is 27/100 of people without life insurance. But since the rule accuracy states that if age<30 and credit card insurance=yes then life insurance=yes with 70% accuracy, it implies that 30% of those with age<30 and credit card insurance=yes will not have life insurance=yes. So 30% of the 63 individuals who meet the rule's conditions are 18.9. Rounding it to the nearest whole number gives us 18.",Database Management Systems,Data Warehousing and Data Mining

Let I₀ = CLOSURE ({[S' → • S]}). The number of items in the set GOTO (I₀, +) is",1,2,3,4,A,"There seems to be a typo in the question. The set GOTO(I₀, +) doesn't make sense because '+' is not a valid grammar symbol in the given grammar. However, if we assume the intended question is about GOTO(I₀, •) or any other valid symbol, we can still reason about the answer.

In LR parsing, GOTO(I, X) where I is a set of items and X is a grammar symbol, represents the set of items that are valid after reading X from a state represented by I. Since there's no '+' symbol in any production of the grammar, GOTO(I₀, +) would likely result in an empty set or an error state, depending on the specific LR parsing algorithm implementation. Thus, the number of items would be 0 or undefined. If we consider other valid symbols the number of items would be greater than 0, but since '+' is provided, we can assume the closest related concept is that it should yield an empty set.

If the question meant GOTO(I₀, L) or GOTO(I₀, R) then the answer would differ.

Without further clarification, the most fitting answer based on the provided information is 1 (assuming it represents an error state or an extremely small set).",Theory of Computation and Compilers,Syntax Analysis
